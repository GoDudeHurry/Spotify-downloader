            "description": "Today’s podcast features two separate, unique stories, that are both themed around the same thing, true Mexican horror. The first story you'll hear is called “The Ritual” and it is about a young man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time during spring break in Matamoros, Mexico. The second story you'll hear is called, “The most feared girl in Mexico” and it is about the horrible thing that a young boy witnessed, when he accidentally stumbled into a cave, high up in the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. DISCLAIMER: This podcast is the remastered audio from 2 popular videos on my \"MrBallen\" YouTube channel. The first story, \"The Ritual\" is from \"Top 3 stories that sound fake but are 100% real | Part 12\" (Here is the link to that video -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK6MIl28b-8). The second story, \"The most feared girl in Mexico\" is from a video of the same name.

But before she could even say, “hello,” she heard her father already saying, \"hello\" to whoever had just called them; He had picked up the other land line telephone upstairs in his bedroom. Heather was about to hang up, but she got curious when she heard the tense, low tone of the person her father was speaking to. So, she decided to just mute her handset and secretly listen in to her dad’s conversation.

After sitting in his seat for a minute, he turned his car off, and then stepped outside into the cold night air. From there, he walked toward the side of his house where there was a path that led around to his front door, but before he could reach his front door, he heard a voice call out to him from somewhere off to his right. The man stopped and stared into the darkness, wondering if he really had just heard a voice at all, but then as he stared, the voice called his name again. Confused, the man walked to the fence at the edge of his property, and looked over it to see who was there. Little did this man know, he had just walked into a trap.For 100s more stories like this one, check out our main YouTube channel just called \"MrBallen\" -- https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBallenIf you want to reach out to me, contact me on Instagram, Twitter or any other major social media platform, my username on all of them is @MrBallen....Note about content:We do not do any original reporting.
